# Python-TopicModelling

In this notebook, we aim to illustrate how to perform topic modelling to extract common topics related travelers' feelings on Twitter about six US Airlines. Through this step-by-step example, it is my hope to provide some guidance about how to apply topic modelling in analysing large, unstructured volumes of text which could hold valuable insights for people and organisations in understanding what is going with current affairs and businesses.

We will be using the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset from Kaggle. The data contains data about how travelers expressed their feelings on Twitter about 6 US airlines in February 2015. You may download the dataset from this URL https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment
